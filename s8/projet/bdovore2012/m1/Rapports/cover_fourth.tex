\section*{Abstract}
BDovore is a website focused on comic books that allows collectors to manage their library. For several years, students in computer science have been developing a software in cooperation with that web site. The principal purpose of this software is to give the same features that the website, but without the obligation of being connected to the Internet. By this fact, the user will be able to handle his library both with the website and the program.
\newline This report is about the work done by students on this software, in 2012.
After a review of the state of the software before their contributions, the present report will focus on these one : first, the reinforcing of some functionalities of the program and then, the synchronization feature (aka the mechanisms to unified the library of the user on the website and in the software).
